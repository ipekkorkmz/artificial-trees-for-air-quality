<h2 align="center"><span><strong>2022 Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality Sustainable Cities Hackathon</strong></span></h2>

Sustainable Cities Hackaton is arranged by Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality and Microsoft Turkey to celebrate The May 19 the Commemoration of Atatürk, Youth and Sports Day. The project "Artificial Trees for Air Quality" has been created by the scope of Sustainable Cities Hackaton, within 3 weeks and the concept of sustainability. With "Artificial Trees for Air Quality" project, our team has managed to be <b>finalist</b> among 9 teams by standing out from 44 teams.


### Project Name
- Artificial Trees for Air Quality 

### Team Members
- Eda Atalay
- Beyza Nur Kebeli
- İpek Korkmaz  

We are students from Istanbul Technical University, Mathematics Engineering major. 

### Problem
- High air pollution (according to the Air Quality Index) especially in certain points and districts
- The scarcity of areas where trees can be planted in Istanbul 

### Solution and End User Experience
- Designing artificial trees that offer air cleaning capacity such as normal trees, covering less space and meet the function of many trees.
- Putting artificial trees to urban locations where air pollution is high and trees cannot be planted (especially in locations where vehicle and human traffic is high).
- Providing air cleaning with these portable artificial trees in places with high air pollution and reducing the high temperature which is the result of global warming.

### Target Group
- Citizens living in Istanbul

### Prototype
- The artificial trees can be produced by an interdisiplinary engineer team in a further extent. (Since, all of our team members are Mathematics Engineers, we are not capable of develop a machine related to artificial trees. We mostly do analysis and machine learning around the data since our profession is about those topics.)
- We determined the most suitable districts for the positioning of these artificial trees by examining the air quality index results and population density factors.

### Technical Architecture / Technology / Data Sources
- Data Sources
  - [IBB Air Quality Station Measurement Results Web Service](https://data.ibb.gov.tr/dataset/hava-kalitesi-istasyon-olcum-sonuclari-web-servisi)
  - [IBB Open Data Portal Municipality Population Dataset](https://data.ibb.gov.tr/dataset/belediye-nufuslari-veri-seti)
- Technology
  - Python
  - R
- Technical Architecture
  - We made data arrangements and the LSTM model in Python software language. The LSTM model predicts future air quality when a certain time series data is entered.
  - We performed the visualization and analysis of these data using the R software language.

### Instructions
- The files related to the project are Turkish because of the concept of hackaton. The files will be converted into English later. Thank you for your understanding. 
- You can find the template of the project in the "hava_kalitesi_icin_yapay_agaclar_template.pptx" file.
- You can find the datasets used throughout the project in the "data" folder.
- You can review the "hackathon_data_hazırlığı_1.ipynb" file for data cleaning & preparation.
- You can review "hackathon_data_gors_2.Rmd" and "hackathon_data_gors_2.html" files for data visualization, analysis and conclusions.
- You can review the "hackathon_lstm_model_3.ipynb" file to view the LSTM prediction model.
- You can view the presentation from the "sunum.pptx" file.
- We recommend that you to review files in the specified order, as explained. The numbers at end of the filenames indicate the review order.
